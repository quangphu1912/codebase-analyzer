description: Use when predicting how a system behaves under different conditions, testing "what if" scenarios for gate combinations, or comparing behavioral fingerprints across configurations

## Announce at start: "Using codebase-analyzer to simulate behavior."

## Overview

Given a tool graph and gate map, predict behavior under different gate combinations. This is where analysis becomes prediction: you're not just mapping what exists, you're simulating what WOULD happen.

**Prerequisites:** Reads `docs/analysis/tool-graph.md` and `docs/analysis/gate-map.md`. Requires both Phase 3 prior skills complete.

## Behavioral Fingerprinting

For each gate combination, produce a behavioral fingerprint:

1. **Available tools** — which tools are active under this combination
2. **Active code paths** — which execution branches are reachable
3. **Accessible data** — what data stores, APIs, and resources are reachable
4. **Exposed capabilities** — what the system can actually do in this state

Compare fingerprints to find surprising differences. Two configurations that look similar may have radically different behavioral profiles.

## Temporal Analysis

How does behavior change over time?

1. **Feature flags** that are on in dev but off in prod
2. **Capabilities scheduled for removal** — deprecated tools still reachable
3. **Time-bombed code** — trial features, expiration logic, rollout schedules
4. **Environment drift** — config differences between dev/staging/production

## State-Space Exploration

Enumerate gate combinations systematically. For N binary gates, there are 2^N possible states. Prioritize exploration:

| Priority | Category | Example | Why |
|----------|----------|---------|-----|
| 1 | Most likely states | Production config | This is what users actually experience |
| 2 | Most surprising states | Admin + external | Capability escalation risk |
| 3 | Most different from baseline | All gates open | Reveals full attack surface |
| 4 | Edge cases | Single gate flipped | Isolation failure detection |

**Pruning:** For large gate counts, group gates by domain (auth, features, providers) and explore intra-domain combinations exhaustively, inter-domain combinations at boundaries only.

## Behavioral Fingerprinting Methodology

For each gate combination, produce a structured fingerprint:

- **Available tools**: Which tools are registered and accessible?
- **Active code paths**: Which branches execute under these conditions?
- **Accessible data**: What data can be reached (databases, APIs, file system)?
- **Exposed capabilities**: What can the user actually DO?
- **Hidden behaviors**: What runs silently (logging, analytics, background tasks)?

Compare fingerprints across scenarios. The DIFFERENCES are the insights. Two configurations that look similar on paper may have radically different behavioral profiles when you examine what's actually reachable versus merely registered.

## Scenario Construction Guide

Don't enumerate all 2^N states. Prioritize:

- **Baseline**: Production config with default user type — your reference point for all comparisons
- **Elevated**: Admin or internal user type — what extra capabilities appear?
- **Degraded**: Missing feature flags, fallback config — what breaks silently?
- **Adversarial**: Combinations that bypass security gates — what shouldn't work but might?
- **Temporal**: Dev vs staging vs production — what changes across environments?

Each scenario should produce a full fingerprint. Then compare fingerprints pairwise: baseline vs elevated (what capabilities appear?), baseline vs degraded (what fails open?), baseline vs adversarial (what security boundaries hold?).

## Gap Detection

After comparing fingerprints, ask:

- Is there a scenario where capabilities EXCEED what the documentation claims?
- Is there a scenario where security controls are silently disabled?
- Are there gate combinations that produce undefined behavior (neither explicitly allowed nor denied)?

These gaps are where bugs and vulnerabilities live. Document each gap with: the gate combination that produces it, the expected behavior, the actual behavior, and the risk if exploited in production.

## Iron Law

```
The most important scenario is the one you didn't think to test.
Systematically explore the state space instead of relying on intuition.
```

## Dispatch Rule

Dispatch `behavior-simulator` agent with gate map + scenarios. Agent traces code paths per scenario, recording:

- Entry points reachable under each combination
- Data flows activated or blocked
- Side effects triggered (file writes, network calls, state mutations)
- Error paths that become reachable

The agent should produce a scenario comparison table showing behavioral differences side-by-side.

## SECURITY_SIGNAL

Gate combinations that warrant immediate attention:

- Combinations exposing admin tools to external/unauthenticated users
- Production configs that skip authentication or authorization checks
- Capability escalation via gate manipulation (user-controlled gate values)
- Combinations where audit logging is disabled alongside sensitive operations
- States where data exfiltration paths become reachable

## Red Flags

- Only testing the default configuration — you're missing the edge cases that attackers exploit
- Not testing adversarial gate combinations — assume gates can be manipulated
- Ignoring compound effects — two benign gates together may create a vulnerability
- Treating all states as equally likely — focus effort on likely + dangerous intersections
- Skipping temporal analysis — behavior changes over time, not just across configs

## Output Contract

Write `docs/analysis/behavior-simulation.md` with:

- Scenario inventory (gate combinations tested)
- Behavioral fingerprints per scenario
- Scenario comparison table
- Temporal analysis findings
- Security signals discovered
- Recommendations for gate hardening
